# Sisyphus

This is a simple web app that helps me vet jobs and companies during a job search. There's a React frontend and a FastAPI backend that uses [linkedin-api](https://github.com/tomquirk/linkedin-api) with my (or anyone's) LinkedIn credentials.

There has been no attempt to make this production-ready.

There are commands in Makefiles to run the frontend and backend in dev mode.
